		    For the spaceship, WASD to move, E to hyperspace (also given on the placeholder starting page)<br>
		    NOTE: The stars were intentionally made to refresh every frame for an optical illusion<br>
		    (As the ship gets faster, the stars behind it appears to follow it :D)<br>
		    If the ship moves without drifting, it is due to the velocities being linked when the spaceship was coded. <br>
		    (To Mr. Chan: I coded all of this myself without regard to the other .pde files, everything will be found in AsteroidsGame.pde.<br>
		    Yes,  that means I did not use the floater class and designed the ship movement myself; I wanted to code everything from scratch :p)
